=head1 SYNOPSIS

The FileResolver role is a specialized form of the Resolver role, and can be
used in its place.  (Anything that does the FileResolver role automatically
does the Resolver role, too.)

FileResolver classes have a native type of Path::Resolver::Types::AbsFilePath
(from L<Path::Resolver::Types>).  Basically, they will natively return a
Path::Class::File pointing to an absolute file path.

FileResolver classes also have a default converter that will convert the
AbsFilePath to a L<Path::Resolver::SimpleEntity>, meaning that by default a
FileResolver's C<entity_at> will return a SimpleEntity.
